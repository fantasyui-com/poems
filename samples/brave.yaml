      - A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit.
      - In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind.
      - Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms.
      - We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death.
      - Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large natureâ€”of what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more.
