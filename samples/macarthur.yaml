      - People grow old only by deserting their ideals, Macarthur had written.
      - Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul.
      - You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young as your hope as old as your despair.

      - In the central place of every heart there is a recording chamber.
      - So long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer and courage, so long are you young.
      - When your heart is covered with the snows of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, then, and then only, are you grown old.

      - And then, indeed as the ballad says, you just fade away.
