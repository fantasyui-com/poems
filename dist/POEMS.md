## Demon (1882) by Friedrich Nietzsche


The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:


This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh… must return to you—all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over again and again—and you with it, speck of dust!


Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: "You are a god, and never have I heard anything more divine!"


If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, "do you want this once more and innumerable times more?" would lie upon your actions as the greatest weight.


Or how well disposed would you have to become to yourself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?


## Desiderata (1952) by Max Ehrmann


Go placidly amid the noise and haste,

and remember what peace there may be in silence.

As far as possible without surrender

be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly;

and listen to others,

even the dull and the ignorant;

they too have their story.


Avoid loud and aggressive persons,

they are vexations to the spirit.

If you compare yourself with others,

you may become vain and bitter;

for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.


Keep interested in your own career, however humble;

it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs;

for the world is full of trickery.

But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;

many persons strive for high ideals;

and everywhere life is full of heroism.


Be yourself.

Especially, do not feign affection.

Neither be cynical about love;

for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment

it is as perennial as the grass.


Take kindly the counsel of the years,

gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.

But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.

Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.

Beyond a wholesome discipline,

be gentle with yourself.


You are a child of the universe,

no less than the trees and the stars;

you have a right to be here.

And whether or not it is clear to you,

no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.


Therefore be at peace with God,

whatever you conceive Him to be,

and whatever your labors and aspirations,

in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.


With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,

it is still a beautiful world.

Be cheerful.

Strive to be happy.


## If— (1895) by Rudyard Kipling


IF you can keep your head when all about you

Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

But make allowance for their doubting too;

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,

Or being hated, don't give way to hating,

And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:


If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;

If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

And treat those two impostors just the same;

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:


If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

To serve your turn long after they are gone,

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'


If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

' Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,

if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,

Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,

And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!


## Invictus (1875) by William Ernest Henley


Out of the night that covers me,

Black as the Pit from pole to pole,

I thank whatever gods may be

For my unconquerable soul.


In the fell clutch of circumstance

I have not winced nor cried aloud.

Under the bludgeonings of chance

My head is bloody, but unbowed.


Beyond this place of wrath and tears

Looms but the Horror of the shade,

And yet the menace of the years

Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.


It matters not how strait the gate,

How charged with punishments the scroll.

I am the master of my fate:

I am the captain of my soul.


## John Galt's Speech (1957) by Ayn Rand


To those of you who retain some remnant of dignity and the will to live your lives for yourselves, you have the chance to make the same choice. Examine your values and understand that you must choose one side or the other. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil.

If you've understood what I've said, stop supporting your destroyers. Don't accept their philosophy. Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, and your love. Don't exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you see around you now. In the name of the best within you, don't sacrifice the world to those who will take away your happiness for it.

The world will change when you are ready to pronounce this oath:

I swear by my Life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for the sake of mine.


## Kosmos (1860) by Walt Whitman


Who includes diversity and is Nature,

Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,

Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,

Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,

Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,

Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,

Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,

The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;

Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,

Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,

The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.


## The Man in the Arena (1910) by Theodore Roosevelt


It is not the critic who counts;

not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,

or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,

whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;

who strives valiantly; who errs,

who comes short again and again,

because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;

but who does actually strive to do the deeds;

who knows great enthusiasms,

the great devotions;

who spends himself in a worthy cause;

who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,

and who at the worst,

if he fails,

at least fails while daring greatly,

so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.


## Kosmos (2017) by Dr. Meow


Who, constructing the world for herself or himself, understands, and in a balance; that it is all of us or none; that we must each strive to live above the common level of life,

Who won't ever cower to switch off; or take the half truth, or the easier wrong, or lie, or cheat, or steal, or tolerate any of those who do,


Who time after time, rose from the ground for the next strike, only to win, by not becoming the snarling beasts they were,

Who deep in disaster never needed names for Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage, Honor, Love; and Insight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;


Who believes that the wellspring of compassion or heroism; is self compassion, or becoming a hero to herself or himself first,

Who will never stop building, and rising and growing, and all the way up, until the world is; Great Beings,


Who may open gateways forward in time to keep herself or himself together; by later remembering to think back, and keep good company,

Who believed all could leap tall buildings in a single bound, and leaped continents, and worlds, but never losing hard won truths, or treasures, or common touch,


Who will never fall down to gnash teeth, or let her or his tools wear down when faced with an uncertain future that may neither have recurrence, nor ends, or may end too soon,

Who in authenticity can face anything or everything, and by subtle analogy discover and fix problems long before they start, seeing most distant heights to reach as new beginnings,


Who will steady down those who made mistakes and teach them, to guard at the gateways of no return; so that they may find meaning in preventing others from breaking too,

Who will sense invisible prison walls, and claw to tear them down, and survive, and thrive, at the beaches facing the starlight of unfolding universe,


Who by enlightenment alone, can hang on to the thinnest thread, and ten minutes forevermore; make each day longer and better than the previous, shaping time and future; the forging of a destiny,

Who in interpretive dance, neither has pain to be his master, nor is willing face uncertainty or disaster, alone; silently winning her or his battles before they are fought,


Who by awakening, contains all lessons, and adventures, and triumph and disaster alike; and whose heart only grows bigger to contain every fracture or ache, who bows to all that is human,

Who not only sees by looking at content of character but also the full sum of a person's history; and thus will neither falter and fail to liars, nor be taken in by the flawless stories of pretenders,


Who wants the world to know it needs not, its vice and crutch; but wisdom and love only; and once we are free from all the imaginary borders; Wisdom, like gravity will act to converge the Human Family, in Health and Peace, together,

Who believes we cannot be taught and it is up to each of us to seek out wisdom and stand on the shoulders of giants; to inherit and continue their work, and help all the future generations stand on our own shoulders, in return,


Who has compassion and enlightenment for all, and all that is all too human; and will not force one thing to become two for shortcut's sake, and protect the sacred borders thereof.

Who by wandering the world, saw ends in shortcuts and shortcuts as delayed ends; and discovered the only way, and the right way, is the longest possible way there.


## Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening (1922) by Robert Frost


Whose woods these are I think I know.

His house is in the village though;

He will not see me stopping here

To watch his woods fill up with snow.


My little horse must think it queer

To stop without a farmhouse near

Between the woods and frozen lake

The darkest evening of the year.


He gives his harness bells a shake

To ask if there is some mistake.

The only other sound’s the sweep

Of easy wind and downy flake.


The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

But I have promises to keep,

And miles to go before I sleep,

And miles to go before I sleep.
