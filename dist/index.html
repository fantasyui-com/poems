                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Heroic Courage</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Benevolence, Compassion</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Respect</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.</div>

                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to &#x27;give their word&#x27;. They do not have to &#x27;promise&#x27;. Speaking and doing are the same action.</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Honour</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Duty and Loyalty</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Self-Control</div>
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.</div>

                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">In spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in a concentration camp, it was possible for spiritual life to deepen. Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom.‎</div>
                  </p>
                  <p class="pb-1">
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one&#x27;s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one&#x27;s own way.</div>
                  </p>
                  <p class="pb-1">
                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity — even under the most difficult circumstances — to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.‎</div>

                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">As we said before, any attempt to restore a man&#x27;s inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal. Nietzsche&#x27;s words, &quot;He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,&quot; could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners.‎</div>

                    <div class="line f3 mb-3">The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him — mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.‎</div>

The truth — that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.‎</div>
