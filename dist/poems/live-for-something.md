# Live for Something


A man must know his destiny. if he does not recognize it, then he is lost. By this I mean, once, twice, or at the very most, three times, fate will reach out and tap a man on the shoulder. if he has the imagination, he will turn around and fate will point out to him what fork in the road he should take, if he has the guts, he will take it.

It’s the unconquerable soul of man, not the nature of the weapon he uses, that insures victory.

Moral courage is the most valuable and usually the most absent characteristic in men.

By perseverance, study, and eternal desire, any man can become great.

An incessant change of means to attain unalterable ends is always going on; we must take care not to let these sundry means undo eminence in the perspective of our minds; for, since the beginning, there has been an unending cycle of them, and for each its advocates have claimed adoption as the sole solution of successful war.

Live for something rather than die for nothing.

You’re never beaten until you admit it.
